Salza
-----

Salza is an implementation of the DEFLATE compressed data format,
described in RFC 1951, and the ZLIB compressed data format, described
in RFC 1950. Currently, only output is supported.

Documentation is coming. For now, see examples/png.lisp and
examples/gzip.lisp to see example uses of the interfaces for DEFLATE
and ZLIB functionality.
