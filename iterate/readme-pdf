To avoid potential problems with different versions of ITERATE, I've included
it in the same repository than cl-pdf and cl-typesetting. 
This version is known to work well with cl-pdf and cl-typesetting.

Anyway, you should use the latest official Iterate version and revert to this one only in case of problems.
